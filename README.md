# fdtaf

The implementation of FDTAF is built on a stable and relatively recent version of QEMU(6.2), which incorporates a combination of dynamic and static techniques, including real-time Virtual Machine Introspection(VMI), precise and comprehensive taint propagation, and asynchronous analysis tools.
